Fetch makes 2 times because of StrictMode hoc in root index.tsx so its not a bag, but feature ;)

You can also add more than 3 currency. Just add it to enum 'currencies' in src/models/currency.ts.

Public api allow to make only 250 requests per month. I updated the api key before pushing project to repo.

Have a nice day)
